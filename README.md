# 🎄 Noel Messages

An interactive Christmas tree where friends can leave encrypted messages. Create your tree, share it, and collect New Year wishes!

## ✨ Features

*   **Personalized Tree:** Create your own Christmas tree with a unique ID.
*   **Two-ID System:** 
    *   🌲 **Tree ID (6 chars):** Share this with friends to let them visit your tree.
    *   🔐 **Admin ID (8 chars):** Keep this secret! Use it to manage your tree from any device.
*   **Encrypted Messages:** All messages are encrypted before being stored.
*   **Interactive Ornaments:** Messages appear as ornaments on the tree. Hover to read them.
*   **Delete Control:** Only the tree owner (with Admin ID) can delete messages.
*   **Bilingual:** Full Turkish and English language support.
*   **Animated UI:** Smooth animations, loading screens, and confirmation modals.
*   **Seasonal:** Active from December 1st to February 1st each year.
*   **Mobile Friendly:** Responsive design for phones and tablets.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Create a Tree** → You receive two IDs (Tree ID + Admin ID)
2. **Share Tree ID** → Friends visit and leave messages
3. **Keep Admin ID Safe** → Use it to delete messages from any browser
